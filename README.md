## üöÄ Getting Started Locally

Follow these instructions to set up and run EstateVal on your local machine.

### 1. Prerequisites

* Python 3.9 or newer
* Git command-line tools

### 2. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/LostSamuraii/django-house-price-predictor.git](https://github.com/LostSamuraii/django-house-price-predictor.git)
cd django-house-price-predictor
```

### 3. Set Up Virtual Environment & Install Dependencies

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate it
# Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# macOS/Linux:
# source venv/bin/activate

# Install required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. ‚ÄºÔ∏è Train Your Machine Learning Model (Crucial Step!) ‚ÄºÔ∏è

This project requires **you to train the machine learning model** using the provided Jupyter Notebook. The trained model artifacts (`.joblib` files) are not included in this repository.

**Instructions:**

1.  **Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab installed.** If not, in your activated virtual environment:
    ```bash
    pip install jupyterlab notebook
    ```
2.  **Launch Jupyter Notebook/Lab:**
    ```bash
    jupyter lab 
    # OR
    # jupyter notebook
    ```
3.  **Open and Run the Notebook:**
    * Navigate to and open the `california_housing_ml_model.ipynb` notebook.
    * **Run all the cells in the notebook from top to bottom.** This notebook will:
        * Load the `dataset/housing.csv` data.
        * Perform data exploration and visualization.
        * Preprocess the data (handle missing values, feature engineer, one-hot encode, scale features).
        * Train a Linear Regression and a Random Forest Regressor model.
        * Evaluate the models.
        * **Crucially, the final cells of the notebook (Step 1.7) will save three files into a `saved_models/` directory in your project root:**
            * `california_housing_model_rf.joblib` (the trained Random Forest model)
            * `california_model_feature_columns.joblib` (the list of feature names the model expects)
            * `california_housing_scaler.joblib` (the fitted StandardScaler object)

    ‚úÖ **These three `.joblib` files MUST be generated and present in `saved_models/` for the web application to function correctly.** The Django backend (`views.py`) is configured to load these specific files at startup.

### 5. Apply Django Database Migrations

```bash
python manage.py migrate
```
(This sets up the initial database, typically SQLite for development.)

### 6. Run the Django Development Server

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```
üéâ Your EstateVal application should now be running at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`!

## üí° How to Use EstateVal

1.  Navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.
2.  The intuitive interface will prompt you for property and district details:
    * Longitude and Latitude
    * Housing Median Age
    * Total Rooms & Bedrooms (for the local block)
    * Population & Households (for the local block)
    * Median Income (in tens of thousands USD, e.g., `3.5` represents $35,000)
    * Ocean Proximity category
3.  Click the **"Estimate Value"** button.
4.  The AI will process your input, and the estimated median house value for a district with those characteristics will appear dynamically!

## üî¨ The Machine Learning Heartbeat

A brief look into the ML pipeline performed by `california_housing_ml_model.ipynb`:

1.  **Data Discovery:** Loading and initial statistical exploration of the California Housing dataset.
2.  **Visual Insights (EDA):** Plotting distributions and correlations to understand feature behaviors (e.g., `median_income`'s strong impact, price capping near $500k).
3.  **Data Transformation (Preprocessing):**
    * *Handling Missing Data:* Imputing missing `total_bedrooms` with the median.
    * *Feature Crafting:* Engineering new insightful features like `rooms_per_household`.
    * *Categorical Conversion:* Using One-Hot Encoding for `ocean_proximity`.
    * *Normalization:* Scaling numerical features with `StandardScaler` for optimal model performance.
4.  **Model Creation & Showdown:**
    * Splitting data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.
    * Training a baseline Linear Regression model.
    * Training a more robust Random Forest Regressor (achieving ~81% R¬≤ on test data).
5.  **Persistence:** Saving the best model (Random Forest), its expected feature order, and the scaler using `joblib` for the Django app.

## üîÆ Future Vision & Enhancements

While EstateVal is fully functional, here are some ideas for future development:

* **Advanced Model Tuning:** Fine-tune the Random Forest with GridSearchCV/RandomizedSearchCV.
* **Richer Features:** Incorporate more diverse features or geospatial analysis.
* **User Personalization:** Add user accounts to save prediction history.
* **Database Integration:** Store prediction inputs and outputs, or even property listings.
* **Interactive Maps:** Visualize predictions or input locations using map APIs.
* **Cloud Deployment:** Take EstateVal live on platforms like Heroku, AWS, or PythonAnywhere!
* **Containerize:** Package with Docker for universal deployment.
* **CI/CD:** Implement a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment pipeline.
* **Alternative Models:** Experiment with other regression models like Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM) or simple Neural Networks.
